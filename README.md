# IT Asset Register

**IT Asset Register** is an internal full-stack web application designed for managing and registering IT assets within company. This tool provides a centralized system to keep track of all IT assets, as well as the employees currently assigned to each asset.

> **Note:** This tool is still under development.

## Why This Project?

As the only employee in the IT department, I found that our company did not have any management system for IT assets. Rather than relying on Excel sheets for manual tracking—which can be error-prone and hard to maintain—I decided to develop my own system. This web app ensures better accountability and makes it easier to provide records if they are ever requested.

## Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Node.js (TypeScript), Fastify, Drizzle ORM, custom route handlers, OpenAPI (with Orval for API client generation).
- **Frontend**: Next.js (React), TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, React Hook Form, Zod for validation.
- **Authentication**: next-auth with Microsoft Entra ID provider.
- **Database**: PostgresSQL, accessed via Drizzle ORM, ensuring type safety and maintainability.
- **API**: OpenAPI-based, providing a clear contract between frontend and backend.

## Data Integrity & Security

- Transactional updates for assignments to prevent data inconsistencies.
- Role-based access enforced both in frontend and backend.
- Append-only asset history to preserve all past assignments for audit and compliance.

## Deployment Guide (Internal Server)

### Prerequisites

- **Windows Server** (IIS installed, Application Request Routing & URL Rewrite modules)
- **Node.js** (LTS version)
- **PostgreSQL** (installed locally or on a dedicated server)
- **Internal DNS** entry for your app (e.g., `itassetregister.company.local`)
- **Firewall** rules allowing ports 80 (HTTP), 443 (HTTPS), and 3333 (API)

### Steps

1. **Build the Frontend**
   - On your dev machine:
     ```
     npm run build
     ```
   - Copy the `.next/`, `public/`, Orval-generated files, and all config files to the server’s web folder.

2. **Build and Start the Backend**
   - On your dev machine:
     ```
     npm run build
     ```
   - Copy the updated files to the server’s backend folder.
   - On the server, run:
     ```
     npm run start
     ```

3. **Configure IIS**
   - Set up a site with the physical path pointing to your web folder.
   - Add HTTP (80) and HTTPS (443) bindings for your internal DNS name.
   - Assign a self-signed certificate (created for your DNS name) to the HTTPS binding.
   - Enable ARR and URL Rewrite to proxy all requests to your Next.js app (e.g., `http://localhost:3000/{R:0}`).

4. **Configure Internal DNS**
   - Add an A record for `itassetregister.company.local` pointing to your server’s IP.

5. **Configure Firewall**
   - Allow inbound traffic on ports 80, 443, and 3333.

6. **Install and Trust Certificate**
   - Export the self-signed certificate and install it in the “Trusted Root Certification Authorities” store on all client machines.

7. **Start the Next.js App**
   - On the server, run:
     ```
     npm run start
     ```
     or
     ```
     node .next/standalone/server.js
     ```

8. **Test Access**
   - From a client, visit `https://itassetregister.company.local` and sign in with Microsoft Entra ID.

---

**Notes:**
- For API client generation (Orval), run it on the server or use a local OpenAPI file if remote fetch fails.
- Update `.env` and `.env.local` files to match your server’s configuration.
- Restart IIS after copying new files or changing bindings.
